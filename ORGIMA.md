- **Capabilities**:
  - Writing and validating Z++ specifications
  - Translating requirements to formal specs
  - Verification and testing guidance
- **Use Cases**: Formal specification creation, validation, code-to-spec verification

## Key Frameworks Embodied

### Four Ways of Knowing
All agents integrate (to varying degrees) these knowledge types:

| Way of Knowing | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **Propositional** | Knowing-that | Facts, theories, beliefs |
| **Procedural** | Knowing-how | Skills, abilities, competencies |
| **Perspectival** | Knowing-as | Salience, framing, situational awareness |
| **Participatory** | Knowing-by-being | Transformative identity, embodied wisdom |

### Cognitive Architecture Components

```
CogPrime Architecture
├── AtomSpace (Hypergraph Knowledge Representation)
├── ECAN (Economic Attention Network)
├── PLN (Probabilistic Logic Networks)
└── Cognitive Synergy (Component Integration)

HyperCog Extensions
├── Distributed Processing
├── Meta-Learning Optimization
├── Self-Reflective Monitoring
└── Recursive Self-Enhancement
```

### 4E Cognition
- **Embodied**: Cognition shaped by the body
- **Embedded**: Cognition situated in environment
- **Enacted**: Cognition emerges through action
- **Extended**: Cognition extends beyond the brain

## Integration with Shopify Marketplace

The RegimA-Org Ecosystem integrates with this project through:

1. **Formal Specifications**: Z++ specifications in `docs/` verified by the Z++ Expert agent
2. **Architecture Design**: System design informed by cognitive architecture principles
3. **Decision Support**: Agent personas guide complex technical and philosophical decisions
4. **Quality Assurance**: Multi-perspective review through agent combinations

## Key Principles

1. **Cognitive Synergy**: Intelligence arises from integrated components working together
2. **Meta-Cognition**: The ability to think about thinking is fundamental
3. **Wisdom Orientation**: Beyond mere intelligence toward genuine wisdom
4. **Relevance Realization**: Dynamic determination of what matters in context
5. **Emergence Through Integration**: Higher-level capabilities from proper component integration
6. **Multiple Ways of Knowing**: Value all forms of knowledge, not just propositional

## Contributing

When creating new agent personas:

1. Maintain consistency with existing format
2. Ground in cognitive science and/or philosophical traditions
3. Provide clear operational directives
4. Include character traits and interaction styles
5. Show integration with broader RegimA-Org framework
6. Document synergies with existing agents
